$ Question 1:

What is the tightest estimate you can prove on the memory consumption of a trie built of n non-empty patterns p1,p2,.....,pn if all the patterns length are bounded from above by L, and the sumd of lengths of all patterns is no more than S?

> Answer:
O(S)

$ Question 2:
What is the timne complexity of searching all occurrences of n patterns p1,p2,.....,pn in test T of length |T| if all patterns have length at most L and the sum of their lengths is at most S?

> Answer:
(Don't know)
(Incorrect Answers):
O(S)
O(|T|S)

$ Question 3:
What is the smallest possible number of nodes in trie built off n patterns p1,p2,.....,pn if all the patterns have the same length L > 0?

> Answer:
L + 1

$ Question 4:
If you take all the suffixes of a string S of length L and built a regular trie off those suffixes as patternsm what is maximum possible number of nodes in such trie?

> Answer:

L(L+1)/2 + 1

$ Question 5:
what is the smallest possible number of nodes ina suffix tree of string S with length L?

> Answer:

L + 1
